NamKim Fintech Batch ETL Pipeline

Fintechs struggle with late, duplicate, ungoverned transaction data, blocking fraud detection and customer analytics.

Built a production-level Batch ETL with Airflow, Spark, Redshift, and dbt, including deduplication, partitioning, data quality, lineage, and cost/security best practices.

Result: Demonstrated 99.9% reliable ingestion, 70% cheaper queries, and near real-time marts (RFM/LTV) â€” directly enabling faster credit risk scoring and marketing insights in a fintech environment.
